## Basics

* All you need is JDK to get started working with Java applications
* JDK contains the core libraries and the tools like compiler, runtime engine etc
* Latest version is 20. You have a release every 6 months	
* the bin folder contains javac, jar, java
* **javac** is the java compiler
* **java** is the execution engine
* complete OO language; case sensitive; statically typed language
* Java code is stored in .java files
* Execution starts from a main method. **public static void main**

```
> javac Hello.java
> java Hello
```

* .class files contain bytecodes. JVM executes the .class files

* **.NET languages**: C#, VB.NET, F#
* **JVM languages**: Java, Groovy, Scala, Kotlin
* **IDE**: Eclipse, Intelli J, NetBeans, Visual Studio Code


### Day 01 recap

* Maven or Gradle
* Data types; Primitive and Reference types
* String -> Immutable
* For string manipulation use StringBuilder instead
* Arrays; syntax is a bit flexible; you can write your square brackets in a number of places


### OO concepts

* Java beans (or POJO); private variables; public getter/setter methods; public methods
* constructor, method overloading
* static or shared members; static members can be accessed using class name or object reference also(not possible in C#)
* default is package-friendly; private, protected, public
* Every .java file can contain any number of classes (not recommended)
* Every .java file can contain only one public class. or each public class should match the name of the .java file
* extends keyword used for inheritance; overriding is straightforward; no keywords required; redefine the method in the super class without changing the signature
* final keyword on methods, prevent overriding; on classes prevent inheritance
* abstract keyword to define abstract classes;

### Day 03

* Generics; Generic Types
* Generics in Java is a compile time technique (or gimmick)
* java.util package contains collection classes; List, Set, Map
* Enums; enum keyword; you can have constructors, methods, variables in an enum
* Lambdas are expressions representing an anonymous inner class
* It is a shortcut implementation of functional interfaces ie., interface with just ONE abstract method
* @FunctionalInterface can be used to mark an interface as a functional interface

### Streams

* Built-in Functional interfaces 
* Predicate, Function, Supplier, Consumer
* **java.util.function** package
* Stream API
* Create a stream on a collection and process the items sequentially
* .stream() is used
* Streams cannot be reused; filter, map, forEach(you don't need a stream)
* A stream processes one item at a time. Takes the item through various stages till the terminal statement
* Streams are lazily evaluated. Unless the terminal statement(get, forEach) is met, the streams are not evaluated
* collect, map, filter, skip, distinct, reduce
